/* Q1. Given a list of activities with their starting time and finishing time. Your goal is to select
maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person such that selected
activities must be non-conflicting. Any activity is said to be non-conflicting if starting time of an
activity is greater than or equal to the finishing time of the other activity. Assume that a person
can only work on a single activity at a time.
